This directory contains files for running the SBN Online Monitoring
Archiver. The archiver runs as a standalone python script. The
dependencies for the script are stored in the requirements.txt file in
this directory.

To setup an environment to run this script, setup a virtual environment:

virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Note that you will need python 2.7 to run the needed redis library. The
sbnd-daq machines have this version of python. However, the gpvm's by
default use python 2.6. If you are developing on the gpvm's, then you
must run instead:

source /cvmfs/fermilab.opensciencegrid.org/products/larsoft/setup
setup python v2_7_15a
# I have a copy of virtualenv setup
~gputnam/virtualenv-15.1.0/virtualenv.py env 
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

After initial setup of the environment, in the future when logging on
you can just run:

source env/bin/activate

Or, if you had to "setup" a python, run:

source /cvmfs/fermilab.opensciencegrid.org/products/larsoft/setup
setup python v2_7_15a
source env/bin/activate

Then you can run the scripts. The script "fill_stream.py" fills a list
of redis Stream instnaces. To use to fill the database instance on
sbnd-daq33, run:

python fill_stream.py -s example -t 1 -hn sbnd-daq33 -pw __password__

Where you should ask Gray what the "__password__" is. In this case, the
name of the Stream object in redis will be "example".
